                                                    Project Overview: Analysis of Car Sales Customer Data

This project leverages SQL methodologies to extract and analyze pertinent information from the car_sales_customer.csv dataset, comprising approximately 1 million rows and a total size of 85MB. The dataset is publicly accessible via Kaggle at the following link: Car Sales Data.

For this analysis, we utilized the DBeaver platform, which facilitates efficient data management and SQL query execution. DBeaver's user-friendly interface allows for seamless bulk uploads of CSV files, making it particularly suited for handling large datasets such as ours.

Our primary objectives include:

     1. Data Exploration: Investigating the dataset's structure and identifying key variables relevant to customer 
     behavior in car sales.
      
     2. SQL Query Implementation: Designing and executing SQL queries to extract meaningful insights and trends from the 
      data.
      
    3.Statistical Analysis: Applying statistical techniques to interpret the results and derive actionable conclusions.

Through this project, we aim to provide a comprehensive analysis of customer preferences and behaviors in the car sales market, contributing valuable insights to stakeholders in the automotive industry.
